    "Mesa is a new, Pythonic agent-based modeling framework. A big advantage of using Python is that it a great language for interactive data analysis. Unlike some other ABM frameworks, with Mesa you can write a model, run it, and analyze it all in the same environment. (You don't have to, of course. But you can).\n",

    "\n",
    "Most models consist of basically two things: agents, and an world for the agents to be in. The Forest Fire model has only one kind of agent: a tree. A tree can either be unburned, on fire, or already burned. The environment is a grid, where each cell can either be empty or contain a tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's define our tree agent. The agent needs to be assigned **x** and **y** coordinates on the grid, and that's about it. We could assign agents a condition to be in, but for now let's have them all start as being 'Fine'. Since the agent doesn't move, and there is only at most one tree per cell, we can use a tuple of its coordinates as a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we define the agent's **step** method. This gets called whenever the agent needs to act in the world and takes the *model* object to which it belongs as an input. The tree's behavior is simple: If it is currently on fire, it spreads the fire to any trees above, below, to the left and the right of it that are not themselves burned out or on fire; then it burns itself out.
